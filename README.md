# django-react

This is a test/demo application written while I was learning React, Material UI, and
how to use them with Django.

The core Django/React parts were originally based on Valentino Gagliardi's blog post at
https://www.valentinog.com/blog/drf/.

Don't expect the code to do anything particularly useful!
