# django-react

This is a test/demo application written while I was learning React, Material UI, and
how to use them with Django.

The core Django/React parts were originally based on Valentino Gagliardi's blog post at
https://www.valentinog.com/blog/drf/.

Authentications parts were originally based on Nik Tomazic's blog post at 
https://testdriven.io/blog/django-spa-auth/.

Other parts were copied/hacked about from the Material UI documentation examples.

Don't expect the code to do anything particularly useful!
